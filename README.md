# VBA-Challenge

The goal of this project is to summarize the stock market for 2014-2016 using VBA.

The desired outcome for each of the three years included:
	
* The Sum of the total volume of stock for each ticker symbol.
* The Change in opening stock price at the beginning of a given year to the closing 	price at the end of the year.
* The percent change in opening stock price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of the year.
* Positive changes should be marked in green and negative changes marked in red.
* For each year, the script identifies the ticker symbol with the greatest % change, greatest % decrease, and the greatest total stock volume.
